# AI-Prompt-Engineering Repository

This repository demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques using multiple large language models (LLMs) – including GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude – to build robust, conversational AI systems. It serves as a showcase for my skill set and certifications, using the Amie chatbot as a key example of how thoughtful prompt design and A/B testing can improve performance and enhance user experience.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting advanced prompt engineering techniques that optimize interactions with LLMs. By leveraging Amie—an AI-driven chatbot designed for Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)—this project highlights how optimized prompts, systematic A/B testing, and detailed performance analysis can lead to superior conversational outcomes.

## Features

- **Optimized Prompts:**  
  Examples of carefully engineered prompts that improve response quality from GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude.

- **A/B Testing Framework:**  
  Side-by-side comparisons of prompt variations to assess their impact on model performance.

- **Detailed Documentation:**  
  In-depth analysis of how different prompt designs affect model outputs, including metrics and user engagement insights.

- **Real-World Application:**  
  Implementation of the Amie chatbot as a case study, demonstrating how prompt engineering is integrated into a production-grade AI system.

- **Scalable Architecture:**  
  Techniques that can be applied to other AI systems and use cases beyond chatbots.
